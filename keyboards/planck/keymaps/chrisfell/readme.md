# Chris's customised layout

Differences from default
- raise+bksp/lower+bksp now maps to del
- raise+esc/lower+esc is now transparent (maps to esc)
- raise+arrows maps to additional nav keys (home, pgdn, pgup, end)
- raise+lower+bottom-left maps to "adjust backlight" 
- holding bottom-left opens a new numpad layer (under the right hand)
- bluetooth is enabled
